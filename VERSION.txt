Project: ClusterMate

0.10.4 (xx-xxx-2014)

#34: Handle JDK client timeout (`java.io.SocketTimeoutException`) explicitly
 (to return 598 aka `ClusterMateConstants.HTTP_STATUS_CLIENT_TIMEOUT_ON_READ`);
 ditto for `java.net.ConnectException` (becomes 599)
- Upgrade to Jackson 2.4.0 (but not relying; 2.3 would still work)

0.10.3 (28-May-2014)

#33: Add support for incremental DELETE operations (similar to how PUTs work)

0.10.2 (06-May-2014)

- Allow overriding of "sync list interrupted" error handling

0.10.1 (28-Apr-2014)

#31: Replica-flag not correctly set when syncing entries
#32: Fix problem of expiration time resetting during synchronization

0.10.0 (11-Apr-2014)

#2: Add a flag that indicates if entry was replicated via sync (as opposed to directly stored)
#3: Add a method in client to count number of copies found
- Upgrade to DropWizard-0.7 (and all downstream deps that requires)
- Require JDK7 (related to above)
- Upgrade to Jackson 2.3.3 (important fixes for DW)

0.9.26 (04-Mar-2014)

- Add "entry info" end point for accessing per-entry cluster-wide metadata
- Explicitly set MIME Content-Type for PUT requests (application/octet-stream)

0.9.25 (08-Feb-2014)

- Fix a problem with pre-mature release of content with PUT operation.
- Add more access in WriteOperation, to figure out if operation can proceed
- Upgrade to Storemate-1.0.1 which fixes that cause problem with sync-pulls
 (orphaned files that cause unnecessary disk space retention)
- Further refactoring to eliminate use of `PathType`, isolate DropWizard deps
- Fixed an issue with AHC-provider, pre-compressed content (was not sending original length)
- Adding more support for client-side compression (to be enabled by implementations)
- Add 'count' to DeleteResponse
- Refactoring to remove BDB deps; none for node-state store, minor remains
  for last-access store (to be eliminated RSN)

0.9.20 (25-Nov-2013)

- Minor improvements to handling of failures to allocate off-heap memory buffers
- Dependency updates (StoreMate 0.9.22, Jackson 2.3.0)
- Refactoring CallParameters, so that all methods take one; and this is used
  also to pass `StoreClientConfig` overrides, if any
- Expose SYNCPULL metrics (was accidentally missing)
- Minor improvements to calculation of sync delay to use, to try to reduce rate
  of calls
- Try to support HTTP Headers better with client
- Need to upgrade StoreMate to roll back BDB-JE version, due to a critical bug.

0.9.15 (27-Sep-2013)

#5: Allow use of -1 and values above node count for 'numberOfCopies', to mean
 "maximum number of copies" (that is, same as number of nodes); this to make
 configuration more robust.
#25: Add conflict resolution for rare case of two nodes receiving differing data
  for same key (older one wins; if tie, one with "higher" content hash)
#29: Add 'PutCallParams' to pass additional parameters through client
- Add new pseudo-cleanup-task for disk space usage tracking.
- Fixed issues with `StoreForTests`, double-initialization (which caused issues
  with cleanup tasks during tests)
   (like max-TTL)
- Refactor FileCleaner to allow overriding of logging details
- Fix a problem with metrics; internal change from millis to nanos made tpXXX
  values exposed as nanos
- Fixed a problem with sync-pull, where server was not updating timestamps after
  internal sleep

0.9.10 (30-Jun-2013)

#22: Redefine field in `EntryLastAccessed` to mean expiration, not create time: needed
#23: Add calls to explicit cleaning of last-accessed entries when entries are deleted
#24: Add extension point(s) for cleanup task for last-accessed entries
#26: Add support for deferred (async) DELETEs.
#28: Upgrade metrics to 3.0.0
- Major update to buffering of request/response, file access
- Improve diagnostics, to expose more information on request/reseponse and
  file systems reads, writes.
- Add support for database/file-system-access - based throttling.
- Add hooks for deletion of last-accessed entries
- Improve rate-metrics exposure
- Refactor handling of paths (PathType) to simplify adding of endpoints
  to support clean up of orphan timestamps (including ones for groups, parent info)
- Add configuration for last-accessed store, to allow use of deferred writes and
  overriding default settings like cache size.
- Allow customization of `CleanerUpper` (via DWBasedService)
- Relocate and refactor `LastAccessStore`, `NodeStateStore`, to allow for non-BDB-JE impls

0.9.5 (30-Apr-2013)

#13: Change logging to use slf4j for client package
#18: Add basic endpoint statistics using Yammer metrics package
#19: Improve shutdown handling, by adding pre-shutdown hooks
#21: Provide `Content-Length` for GET requests
- Increased default read buffer for StreamingResponseContentImpl 8k->16k
- Add more stuff in OperationDiagnostics, for DB read/write, last-access update
  breakdowns

0.8.9 and earlier

#4: Add Servlet/Handler for listing entries
#6: Provide Etag for GET, when content hash known
#7: Support conditional GET with Etag
#8: Fix problems with file auto-cleaning, dangling metadata, failing sync pulls
#11: Use long-polling for SYNC LIST operation
#12: Implement/require external String representation for Keys.
#15: Implement client accessor that uses default JDK-provided http client
#17: Filter out tombstones from `listEntries`.
- Add 'ExtensibleType' base class, to try to improve forwards compatibility
- Fix issues with handling (or lack thereof) of "full items" (ListItem sub-classes)
- Add 'itemCount' property in 'OperationDiagnostics', populate for sync list, pull,
  list entries
- Add 'ListItem' parameterization, to allow custom sub-classes.
- Make 'LastAccessUpdatedMethod' an interface to make values configurable

Earlier notes not maintained; first version (0.5.0) released in September 2012
